# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

***
Here we can see the "Create Account" page:
!["Create Account page"](./app_screenshots/Logon_page.png)
***
Here we have the login page, in case you already created an account:
!["Login page"](./app_screenshots/Login_page.png)
***
Once logged in, you are able to see all your shortened URLs. (Is the page blank? Let's press "Create New URL" in the top-left corner and create new shortened URL!):
!["Empty Main page"](./app_screenshots/Empty_main_page.png)
***
Here take any URL you want, paste it in the form and press "Submit":
!["Shorten the URL page"](./app_screenshots/shortenUrl_page.png)
***
Once we have the shortened URL, we can either press on the short URL which redirects us to the proper website, or simply return to the main page:
!["Edit page"](./app_screenshots/URL_edit_page.png)
***
Here on the main page we can see all our shortened URLs:
!["Main page with URLs"](./app_screenshots/main_page_with_URLs.png)
